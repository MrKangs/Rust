    // Ownership Rules
    // 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
    // 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    // 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    // s is not valid here, because it's not yet declared

        let s2 = "hello"; // s2 is valid and fixed string literal
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward
        // do stuff with s
    } // s is dropped here, and no longer valid
